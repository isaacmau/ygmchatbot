How do you pray for release from a curse?,"There is no one set pattern that everyone must follow. In bringing people to the point of release, however, I have found it useful to lead them through the seven steps outlined below.1. Confess your faith in Christ and His sacrifice on your behalf. In Romans 10:9-10, Paul outlines two essential conditions for receiving the benefits of Christ’s sacrifice. First: believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead. Second: confess with your mouth that He is Lord. Faith in one’s heart is not fully effective until it has been completed by confession with the mouth. Literally, the word confess means ""to say the same as."" In the context of Biblical faith, confession means saying with our mouth what God has already said in His Word. In Hebrews 3:1, Jesus is called ""the High Priest of our confession."" When we make the right scriptural confession concerning Jesus, that confession releases His priestly ministry on our behalf. 2. Repent of all your rebellion and sin. You must accept personal responsibility for your rebellious attitude toward God and the sins that have resulted from that attitude. Here is a suggested confession that expresses the repentance God demands: I give up all my rebellion and all my sin and I submit myself to You as Lord. 3. Receive forgiveness of all sins. One of the specific barriers that keeps God’s blessing out of our lives is unforgiven sin. God has already made provision for our sins to be forgiven, but He will not do this until we confess them. It may be that God has already shown you certain sins that opened you up to a curse. If so, make a specific confession of those sins. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). 4. Forgive all other people who have ever harmed you or wronged you. Another barrier that can keep God’s blessing out of our lives is unforgiveness in our hearts toward other people. Forgiving another person is not primarily an emotion—it is a decision. Ask God to bring to mind anyone you need to forgive. The Holy Spirit will prompt you to make the right decision, but He will not do the forgiving for you. You must do the forgiving, saying out loud: ""Lord, in Your name I forgive ____________ (put in the name here of those who have hurt you)."" 5. Renounce all contact with the occult and/or satanic practices. This confession will include a wide range of activities. If you have been involved in such practices, you have crossed an invisible border into the kingdom of Satan. Since that time, whether you know it or not, Satan has regarded you as one of his subjects. He considers that he has a legal claim to you. You need to finally and forever cut off all such connection with Satan.  If you are unsure about any particular activity, ask God to make it clear to you. You also need to get rid of all objects that could still link you with any of these practices. This includes all images, charms, books, etc. They should be burned, smashed, or otherwise destroyed. 6. You are now ready to pray the prayer of release from any curse. It is important that you base your faith solely upon what Jesus obtained for you through His sacrifice on the cross. You do not have to “earn” your release. You do not have to be “worthy” of it. Here is an appropriate prayer you can declare: Lord Jesus Christ, I believe that You are the Son of God and the only way to God; and that You died on the cross for my sins and rose again from the dead. I give up all my rebellion and all my sin, and I submit myself to You as my Lord. I confess all my sins before You and ask You for Your forgiveness—especially for any sins that have exposed me to a curse. Release me also from the consequences of my ancestors’ sins. By a decision of my will, I forgive all who have harmed or wronged me—just as I want God to forgive me. In particular, I forgive... I renounce all contact with anything occult or satanic—if I have any “contact objects,” I commit myself to destroy them. I cancel all Satan’s claims against me. Lord Jesus, I believe that on the cross You took on Yourself every curse that could ever come upon me. So I ask You now to release me from every curse over my life—in Your name, Lord Jesus Christ! By faith I now receive my release and I thank You for it. 7. Now believe that you have received and go on in God’s blessing! Do not try at this stage to analyze what form the blessing will take, or how God will impart it to you. Leave that in God’s hands. Let Him do it just how and when He will. You do not have to concern yourself with that. Your part is simply to open yourself—without reservation—to all that God wants to do in you and for you through His blessing. It will be exciting to see just how God will respond!"
How do you believe that you have received and go on in God’s blessing?,"The key is to have faith that you have already been released from the curse, and to thank God for it. Then go on in His blessing, without worrying about how He will impart it to you. He will do so in His own time and in His own way."
